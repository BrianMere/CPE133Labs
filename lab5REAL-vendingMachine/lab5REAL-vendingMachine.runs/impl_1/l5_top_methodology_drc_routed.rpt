2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell filter/R_out1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) filter/D_out_reg/CLR, filter/N_out_reg/CLR, filter/Q_out_reg/CLR
filter/R_out_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on B relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on D relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on N relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Q relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on R relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on C_LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on C_LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on C_LED[2] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on C_LED[3] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch filter/D_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin filter/D_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch filter/N_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin filter/N_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch filter/Q_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin filter/Q_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch filter/R_out_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin filter/R_out_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch outputLog/m_signal_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin outputLog/m_signal_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 5 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
